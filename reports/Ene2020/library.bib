abstract = {This paper mainly addresses the building of face recognition system by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical approach used for reducing the number of variables in face recognition. In PCA, every image in the training set is represented as a linear combination of weighted eigenvectors called eigenfaces. These eigenvectors are obtained from covariance matrix of a training image set. The weights are found out after selecting a set of most relevant Eigenfaces. Recognition is performed by projecting a test image onto the subspace spanned by the eigenfaces and then classification is done by measuring minimum Euclidean distance. A number of experiments were done to evaluate the performance of the face recognition system. In this thesis, we used a training database of students of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering department, Batch-2007, Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh.},

abstract = {In the information era, the size of network traffic is complex because of massive Internet-based services and rapid amounts of data. The more network traffic has enhanced, the more cyberattacks have dramatically increased. Therefore, cybersecurity intrusion detection has been a challenge in the current research area in recent years. The Intrusion detection system requires high-level protection and detects modern and complex attacks with more accuracy. Nowadays, big data analytics is the main key to solve marketing, security and privacy in an extremely competitive financial market and government. If a huge amount of stream data flows within a short period time, it is difficult to analyze real-time decision making. Performance analysis is extremely important for administrators and developers to avoid bottlenecks. The paper aims to reduce time-consuming by using Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming. Experiments on the UNSWNB-15 dataset indicate that the integration of Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming can perform better in terms of processing time and fault-tolerance on the huge amount of data. According to the results, the fault tolerance can be provided by the multiple brokers of Kafka and parallel recovery of Spark Streaming. And then, the multiple partitions of Apache Kafka increase the processing time in the integration of Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming.},

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform mainly designed for low latency and high throughput. It is publish-subscribe messaging reassess as a constituent to each of number of legatee of commit log. The key notion of Apache Kafka is that it is used as a cluster on any number of servers. Server of Kafka stores record streams in classes known as topics. Every record contains a key, a value and a time stamp. It has two classes of application. Firstly, for building pipelines of real time data streams which is reliable to get the data between the systems or between the applications. Secondly, build applications streaming for real time that reacts to the record streams. A single Kafka mediator can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads and writes per second from thousands of clients. Scalable Kafka is designed to allow a single cluster to serve the central data backbone for a large organization.},

This paper introduces a deep learning framework to first detect 14 facial key-points which are then utilized to perform disguised face identification. Since the training of deep learning architectures relies on large annotated datasets, two annotated facial key-points datasets are introduced. The effectiveness of the facial keypoint detection framework is presented for each keypoint. The superiority of the key-point detection framework is also demonstrated by a comparison with other deep networks. The effectiveness of classification performance is also demonstrated by comparison with the state-of-the-art face disguise classification methods.},

abstract = {Face verification is a task to determine whether a pair of given facial images belong to the same person. In unconstrained real applications, inter and intra variations, including illumination, pose, occlusion, and expression, will seriously decrease the verification performance. Due to the lack of annotated data for face verification, extended datasets for face recognition with large samples are used to assist learning a robust feature representation generally. However, the extended data for face recognition is different from face verification on distribution and task. In this paper, a transfer learning based on PCA-SVM is proposed to alleviate above problem. The original feature representation is learnt from a deep convolutional neural network by face classification. Then a PCA-SVM based transfer method is used for feature reprojection from the source domain (face recognition) to the target domain (face verification), which reduces the divergence of feature distribution and task inconsistency. The proposed framework yields comparable results and the accuracy is 98.5{\%} on LFW dataset.},

abstract = {Social networks generate enormous amounts of visual data. Mining of such data in recommender systems is extremely important. User profiling is carried out in recommender systems to build the holistic persona of the user. Identification and grouping of images in these systems is carried out using face recognition. It is one of the most appropriate biometric features in such situations. Ever since the first use of face recognition in security and surveillance systems, researchers have developed many methods with improved accuracy. Face recognition under variant illumination is still an open issue and diverging facial expressions reduces the accuracy even further. State of the art methods produced an average accuracy of 90{\%}.In this study, a computationally intelligent and efficient method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is developed. It utilizes the features extracted from texture and wavelet domain. Discrete Wavelet Transform provides the advantage of extracting relevant features and thereby reducing computational time and an increase in recognition accuracy rate. We apply particle swarm optimization technique to select informative wavelet sub-band. Furthermore, the proposed technique uses Discrete Fourier Transform to compensate the translational variance problem of the discrete wavelet transform. The proposed method has been tested on the CK, MMI and JAFFE databases. Experimental results are compared with existing techniques and the results indicate that the proposed technique is more robust to illumination and variation in expressions, average accuracy obtained over the CK, MMI and JAFFE datasets is 98.6{\%}, 95.5{\%}, and 98.8{\%} respectively.},

@article{Elmahmudi2019b,
abstract = {Today, computer based face recognition is a mature and reliable mechanism which is being practically utilised for many access control scenarios. As such, face recognition or authentication is predominantly performed using ‘perfect' data of full frontal facial images. Though that may be the case, in reality, there are numerous situations where full frontal faces may not be available — the imperfect face images that often come from CCTV cameras do demonstrate the case in point. Hence, the problem of computer based face recognition using partial facial data as probes is still largely an unexplored area of research. Given that humans and computers perform face recognition and authentication inherently differently, it must be interesting as well as intriguing to understand how a computer favours various parts of the face when presented to the challenges of face recognition. In this work, we explore the question that surrounds the idea of face recognition using partial facial data. We explore it by applying novel experiments to test the performance of machine learning using partial faces and other manipulations on face images such as rotation and zooming, which we use as training and recognition cues. In particular, we study the rate of recognition subject to the various parts of the face such as the eyes, mouth, nose and the cheek. We also study the effect of face recognition subject to facial rotation as well as the effect of recognition subject to zooming out of the facial images. Our experiments are based on using the state of the art convolutional neural network based architecture along with the pre-trained VGG-Face model through which we extract features for machine learning. We then use two classifiers namely the cosine similarity and the linear support vector machines to test the recognition rates. We ran our experiments on two publicly available datasets namely, the controlled Brazilian FEI and the uncontrolled LFW dataset. Our results show that individual parts of the face such as the eyes, nose and the cheeks have low recognition rates though the rate of recognition quickly goes up when individual parts of the face in combined form are presented as probes.},

Although Viola-Jones algorithm can handle it elegantly, today's bigger and bigger high quality images and videos still bring in the new challenge of real time needs. It is a good idea to parallel the Viola-Jones algorithm with OpenCL to achieve high performance across both AMD and NVidia GPU platforms without bringing up new algorithms. This paper presents the bottleneck of this application and discusses how to optimize the face detection step by step from a very nave implementation. Some brilliant tricks and methods like CPU execution time hidden, stubbles usage of local memory as high speed scratchpad and manual cache, and variable granularity were used to improve the performance. Those technologies result in 4-13 times speedup varying with the image size. Furthermore, those ideas may throw on some light on the way to parallel applications efficiently with OpenCL. Taking face detection as an example, this paper also summarizes some universal advice on how to optimize OpenCL program, trying to help other applications do better on GPU.},

abstract = {With the superiority of three-dimensional (3D) scanning data, e.g., illumination invariance and pose robustness, 3D face recognition theoretically has the potential to achieve better results than two-dimensional (2D) face recognition. However, traditional 3D face recognition techniques suffer from high computational costs. This paper proposes a fast and robust 3D face recognition approach with three component technologies: a fast 3D scan preprocessing, multiple data augmentation, and a deep learning technique based on facial component patches. First, unlike the majority of the existing approaches, which require accurate facial registration, the proposed approach uses only three facial landmarks. Second, the specifical deep network with an improved supervision is designed to extract complementary features from four overlapping facial component patches. Finally, a data augmentation technique and three self-collected 3D face datasets are used to enlarge the scale of the training data. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on four public 3D face benchmarks, i.e., 100{\%}, 99.75{\%}, 99.88{\%}, and 99.07{\%} rank-1 IRs with the standard test protocol on the FRGC v2.0, Bosphorus, BU-3DFE, and 3D-TEC datasets, respectively. Further, it requires only 0.84 seconds to identify a probe from a gallery with 466 faces.},
